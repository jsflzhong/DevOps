# DevOps-Jenkins-library

For Jenkins library,  Since there is a conventional project structure as a MUST structure defined by Jenkins.

So I need to create a new project in GitHub just for POC Jenkins Library.

Refer to project for Jenkins Lib: DevOps-Jenkins-library, link : https://github.com/jsflzhong/DevOps-Jenkins-library
