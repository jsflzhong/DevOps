# DevOps-Jenkins-library

For Jenkins library,  Since there is a conventional project structure structure defined by Jenkins.

So I have 2 choises.

1. Create a new project with default folder structure

    Create a new project in GitHub just for POC Jenkins Library.

    Refer to project for Jenkins Lib: DevOps-Jenkins-library, link : https://github.com/jsflzhong/DevOps-Jenkins-library


2. Put library wherever I want, then config the specific path in Jenkins Golbal Library configuration.
